# Ambi | Stillverse

**Ambi** is a next-generation, multi-mode social architecture designed for Gen-Z. Unlike traditional platforms built on engagement loops and dopamine-driven metrics, Ambi prioritizes **stillness**, **intention**, and **digital wellness**.

## 🌌 Philosophical Pillars
- **Anti-Addiction:** No infinite scroll without reflection. Features like the "Caught Up" state acknowledge when you've reached digital completion.
- **Stillness-First:** A minimalist UI using grain textures, blurs, and Instrument Serif typography to create a "sanctuary" feel.
- **Resonance vs. Engagement:** Metrics are private. We measure "Resonance" (quality of attention) rather than "Viral Spikes" (quantity of noise).
- **Identity Fluidity:** Users can exist as "Anchored" identities or "Guest Echoes," allowing for ephemeral drift or permanent sanctuary presence.

## 🛠️ Core Systems & Mechanics

### 1. Signal Attention Engine (SAE)
The SAE tracks how users interact with content across four modalities:
- **Glances:** Brief visibility as you drift past a post.
- **Holds:** Sustained attention (3+ seconds) indicating intent.
- **Returns:** Re-visiting a specific signal after a period of absence.
- **Deep Interactions:** Active resonance (Reactions, Comments, Captures).

### 2. Intensity Calibration (Dynamic Feed)
Users control their "Aperture Intensity" (0-100%):
- **Low Intensity (0-30%):** Prioritizes mutual signals, calm energy levels, and established connections.
- **Mid Intensity (30-70%):** A balance of the inner circle and interesting "drift" from the collective.
- **High Intensity (70-100%):** Prioritizes novelty, global resonance, and diverse frequencies.

### 3. Anti-Viral Safeguards
To prevent "shallow noise," the ranking system detects **Spike Fatigue**:
- Posts with high Glance counts but extremely low Hold Ratios are penalized.
- Sustained Attention (High Hold-to-Glance ratio) is rewarded with "Synchronicity" status.

### 4. Gemini AI Integration
- **Identity Manifestation:** Gemini generates unique personas (names, handles, bios, brand colors) based on a user's "vibe" input.
- **Aperture Insights:** In the Resonance Lab, Gemini analyzes private interaction data to provide poetic, actionable insights about a creator's presence.
- **Transparency Hints:** AI-generated explanations of why specific signals are appearing in a user's feed.

## 📱 View Architecture

### 🏠 Feed (The Drift)
The primary stream of signals. Supports three sub-modes:
- **SIGNAL:** Direct resonance from your circle.
- **DRIFT:** Discovery of new frequencies.
- **CAPSULE:** Time-locked artifacts revealing themselves.

### 🕸️ Nexus (Connection Map)
A spatial visualization of your social galaxy.
- Nodes represent connections.
- Distance is determined by Signal Strength.
- Rotation and pulse indicate active resonance.

### ✉️ Signals (Dialogue Sanctuary)
Intention-based messaging categorized by "Tone" (Casual, Emotional, Professional, Anonymous).
- Supports **Circle Collectives** (Groups) with anchor/watcher roles.
- Artifact sharing (images/files) with blurred previews for privacy.

### 🏛️ Sanctuary (Profile)
Your digital home. Features multiple layers:
- **Artifacts:** Permanent visual and text signals.
- **Traces:** Ephemeral stories that decay over 1-24 hours.
- **Vault:** Private resonance notes for the self.
- **Archives:** Time capsules locked for future revelation.
- **Resonance Lab:** Private analytics (Fatigue Index, Pulse Wave).

## 🌑 Aesthetic Guidelines
- **Typography:** `Instrument Serif` (Italic) for soul; `Plus Jakarta Sans` (Uppercase, Tracking) for structure.
- **Colors:** Deep blacks (`#0A0A0A`), soft bone whites, and mode-specific pastels (Connect: `#E8D5C4`, Create: `#D4C4E8`, Think: `#C4E8D5`).
- **Texture:** CSS-based grain overlays and backdrop blurs (`backdrop-blur-3xl`) create a sense of depth and physical presence.

## 🚀 Working Processes
1. **Emit Signal:** Every interaction (View, React, Comment) emits a "Signal" that updates the mutual resonance score between two users.
2. **Decay Logic:** Signals lose 5% strength per day of inactivity to ensure the "Inner Circle" reflects current life phases.
3. **Capture:** Sharing a post creates a "Memory Artifact" in your own Sanctuary, preserving the drift.
4. **Anchor Identity:** Guests can "Anchor" at any time, converting their ephemeral session into a permanent sanctuary using Gemini-assisted creation.
